# Chapter 10: Convolutional Neural Networks

Important terms:

- Stride, kernel size, dilation. **Dilation** is putting spaces between the points used in the convolution.
- **Valid padding:** no padding at all
- The **receptive field** of a hidden unit is the region of input points that feed into it.
- "Another way of thinking about this is that when we train the convolutional network, we search through a smaller family of input/output mappings, all of which are plausible. Alternatively, the convolutional structure can be considered a regularizer that applies an infinite penalty to most of the solutions that a fully connected network can describe."
